## 📸 Technical Highlights

### **Dynamic Branding Engine**
The website utilizes a `:root` variable strategy to update the color palette instantly. When a user interacts with the `theme-toggler`, JavaScript updates the `--theme-color` property globally, ensuring a consistent brand experience across all components.



### **Responsive Architecture**
The layout is optimized for all devices:
* **Desktop:** Multi-column grids and expanded navigation.
* **Tablet:** Adaptive padding and stacked review cards.
* **Mobile:** Hamburger menu navigation and single-column touch-optimized sliders.
